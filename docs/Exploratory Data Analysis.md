# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Addis Ababa

1. NO<sub>2</sub>:

For both weekdays and weekends, there is a prominent concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> in the northwestern region. This region, highlighted in pink in Figure 3, is the heart of Addis Ababa. It is where most of the roads converge. Most of the Addis Ababa Light Rail System is located here as evidenced by Figure 2. The Addis Ababa Bole International (ADD) Airport is located towards the southeast of this region as shown in Figure 3. The figure also shows the major highway corridors of A1 and A2. The A1 highway connects Addis Ababa to Dire Dawa and Djibouti, and it is a part of the Trans African Highway network. These mobility systems may be major contributing factors to the NO<sub>2</sub> levels in this region. The southeast and eastern parts show markedly lower NO<sub>2</sub> levels. This area is mostly marked by extensive cropland, indicating higher agricultural activity rather than industrial production. The extreme northern and northeastern border regions also show lower NO<sub>2</sub> levels which is in line with the region being forest land.

On closer inspection, we also notice lower NO<sub>2</sub> levels on weekends as compared to weekdays, particularly in the northwestern region. This may be associated with lower economic activity on the weekends (less people travelling to work, businesses being shut). The daily subregional NO<sub>2</sub> levels have been attached in the Appendix Figure 3. All the subregions consistently show a spike in NO<sub>2</sub> levels in February-March and November-December, with a marked decrease in August. In Ethiopia, February-March and November-December fall in the dry season; with dry, stable atmospheric conditions and low wind which can trap pollutants near the surface due to poor vertical mixing. The period also coincides with pre-holiday commerce and traffic activity due to festivals and the peak tourist season. On the other hand, August sees the highest rainfall in Ethiopia, which may be the reason for the drop in NO<sub>2</sub> levels due to washing away of NO<sub>2</sub>, as highlighted in the Literature Review.

2. Population:

The population distribution for 2023 and 2024 also shows a similar trend to NO<sub>2</sub>, i.e., a possibly high correlation to the transport network and industrial production regions. Particularly, two offshoots are observed spreading from the northwest horizontally to the east and diagonally to the south. For the first case, the presence of the East-West line of the LRT corridor and A1 highway may be a possible reason. For the second case, higher population is observed along the North-South line of the LRT followed by the A1 highway corridor. 

Similar to NO<sub>2</sub>, lower population numbers are observed in croplands and forested regions. The total population in this region increased by 2.17% to about 4,281,917.

3. Industrial Area:
The industrial land use area distribution as shown in Figure 5 also shows higher values along the A1 highway corridor. Furthermore, higher industrial area towards the east can be attributed to the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) of Bole Lemi as shown in Figure 6.

4. Points of Interest:
The points of interest data was processed to obtain the total percentage of POI expected to produce considerable amounts of NO<sub>2</sub> due to industrial activity and/or mobility. These POI included supermarkets, hospitals, car dealerships, car rentals, carwash, marketplaces, malls, and universities. Comparing Figure 3 and Figure 7, a higher concentration of POI is observed in the heart of Addis Ababa.

5. Road Length:
The total road length per cell was calculated in metres per cell as shown in Figure 8. Comparing this with figures 2, 3, and 4, we observe a correlation between the persistence of roads, LRT, and population distribution.
